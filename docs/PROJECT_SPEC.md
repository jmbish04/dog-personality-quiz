results (
  id, session_id, title, summary,

## üé® Result Image Generation Flow

- AI uses:
  - Trait name
  - Score
  - Dog name, breed, age
  - Uploaded or base AI image
- Produces:
  - Stylized image for trait + score
  - Saved to R2: `r2/results/{slug}-{trait}.png`
  - Referenced in `results.generated_images`

---

## üîÑ AI-Generated Questions (Final 5 pages)

For each trait (love, loyalty, etc):
- Use prompt:  
  > "Generate 1 fun multiple-choice question to assess [TRAIT], based on what we know: [prior answers]. Provide 3‚Äì4 short answer options."

- The frontend shows:
  - The question as page content
  - Answer options as buttons

There should be a button to share the results so if users are on iPhone for example it opens the share window for th user to text a link to a friend or however they go about inviting others
